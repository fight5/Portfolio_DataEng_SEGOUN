# [Portofolio] - ShowNotTell - ARIEL - SEGOUN - #5 - FROM POC TO PROD: StackOverflow Tag Prediction Service


## Introduction

"FROM POC TO PROD" is a Flask-based web application designed to predict tags for StackOverflow questions. Transitioning from a proof of concept (POC) to a production-ready application, this project encapsulates the transition phase where the focus is on building a reliable, scalable, and user-friendly application that leverages machine learning for text classification.

## Problem Description
In the realm of software development and data science Q&A, efficiently categorizing content is key to improving user experience and information retrieval. 
StackOverflow, a major platform in this field, requires a robust system that can automatically assign relevant tags to questions to ensure they are easily searchable and reach the right audience.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a Flask web application that provides an intuitive interface for users to input StackOverflow question titles and receive predicted tags.
- Implement a machine learning pipeline that processes text input and outputs prediction tags, leveraging trained models and state-of-the-art text embedding techniques.
- Transition the project from a proof of concept to a production-grade system with an emphasis on code quality, maintainability, and scalability.
- Ensure that the application is secure, with appropriate error handling and validation to mitigate potential risks associated with web deployments.

## Key Features

- User-Friendly Interface: A Bootstrap-based front end that is simple and intuitive for end-users to interact with the machine learning model.
- Machine Learning Integration: Integration of TensorFlow and Keras for running a neural network that predicts tags based on the text of a StackOverflow question.
- Scalability: Structured codebase that is ready for scaling up to handle increased load and additional features as needed.
- Robust Testing: Comprehensive test suite for the prediction logic, ensuring reliability and accuracy of the tag predictions.
